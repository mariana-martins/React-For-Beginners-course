# Course React for Beginners by Wes Bos

This is my final code from React course.
The project is a real-time app for a
trendy seafood market where price and quantity available
are variable and can change at a moment's notice. I built
a menu, an order form, and an inventory management
area where authorized users can immediately update
product details using Facebook login.

## How to Run

Before running, you need to install all dependencies using the
following command line:

```
npm install
```

Then, you can run this project using the following command line:

```
npm run start
```

It will start a webserver at port `3000`, which reloads automatically
if there're changes on the source code.

If you want to generate all files to deploy on production, use the
following command line:

```
npm run build
```
